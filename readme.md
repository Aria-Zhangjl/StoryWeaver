# StoryWeaver
This is an official implementation of AAAI 2025 paper [StoryWeaver: A Unified World Model for Knowledge-Enhanced Story Character Customization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07375). The proposed StoryWeaver can achieve both single- and multi-character based story visualization within a unified model. For more detailed explanations and supplementary materials, please refer to our [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07375) version. At the same time, we will continuously update the arXiv paper with more experiments.
